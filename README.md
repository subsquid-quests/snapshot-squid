# Deploy a Snapshot squid

This is a quest to run a squid migrated from the [Snapshot subgraph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/snapshot-labs/snapshot) by [@0xNomind](https://github.com/0xNomind/snapshot-squid), one of the winners of the [migration quest](https://github.com/subsquid-quests/snapshot-subgraph-migration). You can find the original repository [here](https://github.com/0xNomind/snapshot-squid).

Here is how to run the squid:

### I. Install dependencies: Node.js, Docker, Git.

<details>
<summary>On Windows</summary>

1. Enable [Hyper-V](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v).
2. Install [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).
3. Install NodeJS LTS using the [official installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
4. Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

In all installs it is OK to leave all the options at their default values. You will need a terminal to complete this tutorial - [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) bash is the preferred option.

</details>
<details>
<summary>On Mac</summary>

1. Install [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).
2. Install Git using the [installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/) or by [other means](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).
3. Install NodeJS LTS using the [official installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

We recommend configuring NodeJS to install global packages to a folder owned by an unprivileged account. Create the folder by running
```bash
mkdir ~/global-node-packages
```
then configure NodeJS to use it
```bash
npm config set prefix ~/global-node-packages
```
Make sure that the folder `~/global-node-packages/bin` is in `PATH`. That allows running globally installed NodeJS executables from any terminal. Here is a one-liner that detects your shell and takes care of setting `PATH`:
```
CURSHELL=`ps -hp $$ | awk '{print $5}'`; case `basename $CURSHELL` in 'bash') DEST="$HOME/.bash_profile";; 'zsh') DEST="$HOME/.zshenv";; esac; echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/global-node-packages/bin:$PATH"' >> "$DEST"
```
Alternatively you can add the following line to `~/.zshenv` (if you are using zsh) or `~/.bash_profile` (if you are using bash) manually:
```
export PATH="${HOME}/global-node-packages/bin:$PATH"
```

Re-open the terminal to apply the changes.

</details>
<details>
<summary>On Linux</summary>

Install [NodeJS (v16 or newer)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager), Git and Docker using your distro's package manager.

We recommend configuring NodeJS to install global packages to a folder owned by an unprivileged account. Create the folder by running
```bash
mkdir ~/global-node-packages
```
then configure NodeJS to use it
```bash
npm config set prefix ~/global-node-packages
```
Make sure that any executables globally installed by NodeJS are in `PATH`. That allows running them from any terminal. Open the `~/.bashrc` file in a text editor and add the following line at the end:
```
export PATH="${HOME}/global-node-packages/bin:$PATH"
```
Re-open the terminal to apply the changes.

</details>

### II. Install Subsquid CLI

Open a terminal and run
```bash
npm install --global @subsquid/cli@latest
```
This adds the [`sqd` command](/squid-cli). Verify that the installation was successful by running
```bash
sqd --version
```
A healthy response should look similar to
```
@subsquid/cli/2.5.0 linux-x64 node-v20.5.1
```

### III. Run the squid

1. Open a terminal and run the following commands to create the squid and enter its folder:
   ```bash
   sqd init my-snapshot-squid -t https://github.com/subsquid-quests/snapshot-squid
   ```
   ```bash
   cd my-snapshot-squid
   ```
   You can replace `my-snapshot-squid` with any name you choose for your squid. If a squid with that name already exists in [Aquarium](https://docs.subsquid.io/deploy-squid/), the first command will throw an error; if that happens simply think of another name and repeat the commands.

2. Press "Get Key" button in the quest card to obtain the `snapshot.key` key file. Save it to the `./query-gateway/keys` subfolder of the squid folder. The file will be used by the query gateway container.

3. The template squid uses a PostgreSQL database and a query gateway. Start Docker containers that run these with
   ```bash
   sqd up
   ```
   Wait for about a minute before proceeding to the next step.

   If you get an error message about `unknown shorthand flag: 'd' in -d`, that means that you're using an old version of `docker` that does not support the `compose` command yet. Update Docker or edit the `commands.json` file as follows:
   ```diff
            "up": {
            "deps": ["check-key"],
            "description": "Start a PG database",
   -        "cmd": ["docker", "compose", "up", "-d"]
   +        "cmd": ["docker-compose", "up", "-d"]
          },
          "down": {
            "description": "Drop a PG database",
   -        "cmd": ["docker", "compose", "down"]
   +        "cmd": ["docker-compose", "down"]
          },
   ```

4. Prepare the squid for running by installing dependencies, building the source code and creating all the necessary database tables:
   ```bash
   npm ci
   sqd build
   sqd migration:apply
   ```
5. Start your squid with
   ```bash
   sqd run .
   ```
   The command should output lines like these:
   ```
   [api] 23:33:48 WARN  sqd:graphql-server enabling dumb in-memory cache (size: 100mb, ttl: 1000ms, max-age: 1000ms)
   [api] 23:33:48 INFO  sqd:graphql-server listening on port 4350
   [processor] 23:33:49 INFO  sqd:processor processing blocks from 11000000

   [processor] 23:33:57 INFO  sqd:processor 11010199 / 18377705, rate: 1735 blocks/sec, mapping: 488 blocks/sec, 428 items/sec, eta: 1h 11m
   ```
   The squid should sync in about 1.5 hours. When it's done, stop it with Ctrl-C, then stop and remove the auxiliary containers with
   ```bash
   sqd down
   ```

# Acceptance critera

Sync this squid using the key from the quest card. The syncing progress is tracked by the amount of data the squid has retrieved from [Subsquid Network](https://docs.subsquid.io/subsquid-network).

# About this squid

The Ethereum data ingester ("processor") is located in `src/main.ts`. It can be started with `sqd process`. GraphQL server runs as a separate process started by `sqd serve`. You can also use `sqd run` to run all the services at once.

The squid uses [Subsquid Network](https://docs.subsquid.io/subsquid-network) as its primary data source.
